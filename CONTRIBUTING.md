## Contributing to the Swift Package Index

If you spot a bug or want to make a small fix to the site, pull requests are welcome.

We're also happy to accept well-written bug reports. Before filing a bug report, please browse the [list of open bugs](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) to see if someone else has already logged it. If not, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/new/choose).

If you have a feature request, a good first step is to look through the [list of open issues](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues) and see if it’s already under discussion. If it’s not, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/new/choose). For feature development, we prefer to receive issues rather than completed pull requests. After a discussion, if the enhancement you’re proposing fits well with our vision for the index, we’ll encourage you to take it to a pull request.
