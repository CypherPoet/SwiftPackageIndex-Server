### Package Collections

Package Collections are a new feature of Swift 5.5 and the Swift Package Index supports it by dynamically creating package collections for authors.

For example, here's a collection of [all packages authored by Apple](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/collection.json). Package collections are [available on all package author pages](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple) throughout the index.
